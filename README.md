# Post Application 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What was done?

The exercise was developed with React, Tailwind & JSONPlaceholder API. The implementation of components facilitated their reusability and sharing the corresponded data.

### What can be done with the app?

At the top of the site a button can be found which display all the data fetched from the API and when it's pressed again this will display the data posted by the user saved in their local storage.
